"* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services."

"* With a bigger budget we can scale up the RDS instances so they can handle more data."
"* Also we can return the ec2 instances for their previous m5.4xlarge type. The baseline number of EC2 instances running is
higher to serve more requests and can scale out when needed."
