# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
A Web Application Firewall (WAF) would protect the application against undesired access.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the 
unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
It wouldn't prevent unauthorized access. Althogh traffic to the S3 bucket would not have to leave aws infrastructure.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, encryption will only be applied to objects going foward (new objects).

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
All configurations made via the aws console would be lost.
