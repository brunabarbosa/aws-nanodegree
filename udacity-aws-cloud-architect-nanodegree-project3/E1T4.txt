Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
S3 bucket connection is leaving the aws infrastructure and throgh the internet. 
An S3 VPC endpoint provides a way for an S3 request to be routed through to the Amazon S3 service, 
without having to connect a subnet to an internet gateway.

# Poor practice 2
Security Group - WebAppSg should restrict ip access in order to only the intended users to have access.
