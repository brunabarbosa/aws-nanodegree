# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

GuardDuty found two finding types:

SEVERITY LOW - 10.192.11.137 is performing SSH brute force attacks against i-0602b849b3a00114e. Brute force attacks are used to gain 
unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password. 
SEVERITY HIGH - 
i-02166b590f66bce23 is performing SSH brute force attacks against 10.192.10.161. Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized 
access to your instance by guessing the SSH password.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source 
of information.
According to the aws documentation Attacks can occur because a rule with Type SSH allows connections from all sources (0.0.0.0/0) 
over Port Range 22. Allowing 0.0.0.0/0 over Port Range 22 introduces a security risk.

Typically these attacks come from bots that are looking for targets to intrude EC2 instances. You can mitigate the risk of 
intrusion by restricting SSH access. It's a best practice to configure security groups to allow SSH access only from 
specific sources that you own, such as from bastion hosts.
